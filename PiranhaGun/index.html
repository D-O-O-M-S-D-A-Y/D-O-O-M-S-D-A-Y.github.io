					<p>
						The Piranha Gun is a very complex piece of machinary. Using the most up to date tech, it allows for you
						to shoot piranhas straight from your finger tips. The Piranha Gun comes loaded with 30 piranhas with the option
						for a larger storage capacity, or extra ammmo purchases. The velocity of the Piranha Gun is still in a slight
						development stage, only being able to shoot piranhas at around 5-7 feet per second, with a max range of 20 feet.
					</p>
					<p>
						We aim to increase these values to at minumum 15 feet per second, with a max range of 50 feet within the next
						year. Maintenance for the Piranha Gun can be a tad annoying but that is a small price to pay for being able to
						shoot piranhas. They are still living piranhas so you will be required to feed them once a day. Changing the water
						can certainly be helpful but is not required. It mostly depends on how frequently you are going to be using your
						Piranha Gun. 
					</p>
					<p>
						The Piranha Gun also comes with a foldable version. This one will fold and shrink using our latest tech to allow
						for easy storage in a pocket or coat. The last thing you would want is for people to know that you are caring
						around The Piranha Gun.
